Melissa is a <del>virtual</del> assistant for OS X, Windows and Linux systems. She currently uses either Google's speech-to-text engine or CMU's Sphinx, OS X's `say` command or Linux's `espeak` command along with some magical scripting which makes her alive, developed by [Tanay Pant](http://tanaypant.com) and a group of sorcerers.
